Plant Health Monitoring System

Overview:

This project aims to develop a Plant Health Monitoring System using a Raspberry Pi 4 and various sensors. The system utilizes a camera and AI for disease detection, a humidity sensor to monitor environmental conditions, and WiFi connectivity for real-time notifications. The goal is to provide early detection of plant illnesses, allowing timely intervention to protect and optimize agricultural production.

Key Features:

Disease Detection: Utilizes a camera and AI to analyze plant images for color variations and disease markings.
Environmental Monitoring: Incorporates a humidity sensor to detect changes in environmental conditions that may lead to plant diseases.
Real-time Notifications: Sends notifications via WiFi to a mobile app, alerting plant owners about potential illnesses at an early stage.
Raspberry Pi 4: Acts as the central processing unit, managing data acquisition, analysis, and communication with external services.

Hardware:

Raspberry Pi 4,
Camera Module,
DHT22 Humidity Sensor,
WiFi Connectivity
